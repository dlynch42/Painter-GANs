# CycleGAN for Image Transformation

## Introduction
Welcome to the CycleGAN project for generating images in the style of Monet from target photos. This repository implements the CycleGAN architecture, which learns mappings between two domains (images) using deep neural networks. In this case, we aim to translate photos into paintings resembling the style of Monet's artworks.

## Overview
CycleGAN is unique because it employs two generators (`G` and `F`) and two discriminators (`D_X` and `D_Y`). Unlike traditional GANs, CycleGAN focuses on not only generating realistic images (`GAN loss`) but also ensuring that the translated images can be reversed to their original forms (`cycle consistency loss`). This dual-loss mechanism helps preserve key characteristics of the original images during translation.

The primary components of this implementation include:
- **Generator (`G`)**: Transforms photos (`X`) to Monet-style paintings (`Y`).
- **Generator (`F`)**: Transforms Monet-style paintings (`Y`) back to photos (`X`).
- **Discriminator (`D_X`)**: Distinguishes real photos from generated Monet-style paintings.
- **Discriminator (`D_Y`)**: Distinguishes real Monet-style paintings from generated photos.

## Architecture
The model architecture consists of:
- Downsample and Upsample layers to extract and reconstruct features at multiple scales.
- Instance Normalization to stabilize and accelerate training.
- Group Normalization to handle different batch sizes effectively.
- Convolutional and Transpose Convolutional layers for image transformation.

## Dataset Preparation
Data is prepared using:
- JPEG and TFRecord files for both Monet paintings and photos.
- TensorFlow's data processing utilities (`tf.data`) for efficient dataset management.
- Custom functions (`decode`, `read`, `load_dataset`, `gan_dataset`) to load, decode, and preprocess images.

## Model Training
- **Initialization**: Models are initialized within a TensorFlow strategy (`MirroredStrategy` or `TPUStrategy`) based on available hardware (CPU, GPU, or TPU).
- **CycleGAN Class**: A custom Keras model (`CycleGAN`) encapsulates the training loop, loss functions, and optimization steps.
- **Loss Functions**: Defined for generators (`gen_loss_fn`), discriminators (`disc_loss_fn`), cycle consistency (`cycle_loss_fn`), and identity mapping (`identity_loss_fn`).
